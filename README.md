Applying the knowledge acquired to use in a better way github and gitkraken

## Project Description:
On this episode, lol, Im getting a website responsive, plus getting the icons of the favicons directory on use.

## My challenges:
What can I say? still struggle with the gitkraken, so creating branches was a great challenge, now I learned how to create branches on gitkraken, was great, even I enjoyed the fact to being able to see the mergin on the gitkraken. Github in the other hand tought me about resolving issues about merging

## What I have learned?
* Resolve conflicts on github.
* Retake a file on gitkraken to be able to modify it or to create a branch.
* Cookies needs to be cleared to get the icons running.

## Skills to practice:
* github
* markdown
* gitkraken
* spellcheck
